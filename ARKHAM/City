Arkham City

Playable Villains Pack
Unlocks characters like Joker, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, and even Ras al Ghul for use in challenge maps. Wild seeing their unique animations and attacks in action. Turns challenge maps into full-on "what-if" scenarios.

Catwoman Story Expansion Mod
Re-adds cut lines and content that fleshes out her role in the main story. Makes her feel like a second protagonist rather than just a side-DLC character. Her sections flow better and feel way more important.

PC Unlocker Mod
Unlocks console-exclusive skins like Sinestro Corps Batman, Earth-2, and Batman Inc. These were originally locked behind timed promotions or console versions — now they’re fair game.

Map Restoration Pack
Restores cut rooms and beta content, like early versions of Wonder Tower interiors or unused interiors from the Steel Mill. Great for exploration and for seeing what could’ve been.

Reshade Raytracing Preset
Simulates raytraced lighting using post-processing. Makes surfaces reflect light realistically and creates dramatic shadows. Basically gives Arkham City a fake RTX facelift — and it slaps.

Skip QTE Mod
Removes or shortens those button-mash Quick Time Events. Speeds up boss fights and cutscenes, making gameplay flow much better.

Custom Soundtrack Packs
Swaps background music for BTAS tracks, Zimmer’s Dark Knight trilogy score, or even fan-made remixes. Changes the entire tone — going from comic book camp to full cinematic thriller.

Alt Suit Swaps
Includes fan-favorite skins like:

1989 Batman – Keaton nostalgia in every glide.

White Lantern – Cosmic clean with glowing FX.

Classic Batsuit – Grey and blue old-school drip.

HD Texture Overhaul
Overhauls city textures — walls, floors, buildings — with AI-upscaled or artist-created versions. It’s subtle but makes the entire game feel way sharper.

Grapple Boost Anywhere
Removes restrictions on using the grapple boost. Now you can launch from literally any ledge or perch, not just predefined ones. Makes traversal way more fun.

Expanded Challenge Map Mod
Adds dozens of custom challenge maps — some fan-made, some restored from cut content. Includes night and weather variations for extra spice.

Free Roam Mod (Post-Story)
Normally the game soft-locks certain areas after you finish. This mod lets you freely explore all districts as any unlocked character once the story ends. Perfect for RP or chill glides.

Fog & Lighting Tweaks
Subtle ENB-style mod that changes time-of-day and weather settings. Gotham gets more variety — from moody fog to sunrise glows.

Playable Robin & Nightwing (Open World Hack)
Normally locked to challenge maps, this mod lets you use them in freeroam, even in the story. They’ve got full combat and traversal — it’s a bit buggy but hella fun.

Reanimated Cutscenes
Adds smooth transitions to a few awkward cutscenes and fixes frame pacing issues in certain boss fights.
