No Tank Missions Mod
One of the biggest criticisms of Arkham Knight was how often it forced you into Batmobile tank battles. This mod either removes or drastically reduces those missions. For me, this shifted the focus back to what the game does best — stealth, freeflow combat, and detective work — not driving a tank through the streets.

Better Grapple Mod
This speeds up grapple transitions, cuts animation delays, and makes zipping around Gotham smoother and more responsive. The city feels more alive when you can move through it at the speed Batman should move.

Expanded Free Roam
Unlocks characters like Nightwing and Robin to roam Gotham in the open world after the main story. Normally, they’re limited to specific missions or challenge maps. This added a whole new layer of replayability — flying across rooftops as Nightwing hit different.

E3 Graphics Restoration
Restores lighting, fog, and effects shown in the early E3 demos but cut from the final game. Makes Gotham look like a next-gen city with dramatic lighting and weather effects. Combine this with Reshade? Chef’s kiss.

Playable Bruce Wayne
Swaps out the Batman character model so you can explore the city unmasked. It's a simple change but adds a personal feel — like seeing Bruce deal with Gotham as a man, not just the myth.

New Combat Animations
Enhances or replaces Batman's animations for punch combos, takedowns, and counters. The result? Combat feels snappier, more cinematic, and less robotic.

Batgirl in Gotham
Breaks the boundaries set by her DLC so she can be used to explore the full Gotham map. It’s cool seeing her interact with the world outside her small story bubble, and lets you imagine an alternate universe where she’s the one defending the city.

Classic Batmobile Mods
Replaces the tank Batmobile with iconic versions — like the ‘89 Michael Keaton Batmobile or the Animated Series one — and lets you use them permanently. Not just skins either — fully replaces the model and sound for nostalgia-heavy vibes.

Combat Challenge Packs Revamped
Reworks the enemy setups in challenge maps for better pacing and difficulty. You get more variety in enemy types, smarter AI, and cleaner wave transitions, making the challenge maps worth replaying.

Reshade Presets
Used custom filters to boost contrast, add cinematic effects, and give the game a gritty noir feel. I made Gotham look like it came straight out of The Batman (2022). Visual storytelling on point.

Free Roam Mod
Unlocks the entire city for exploration even after the story ends, including areas usually locked behind main missions. Great for roleplay, side content cleanup, or just chilling on rooftops in the rain.

First-Person Mode
Converts gameplay into first-person view. It’s surprisingly immersive — especially when gliding or driving the Batmobile. Makes you feel like you are Batman, not just controlling him.

Better Rain & Fog
Tweaks Gotham’s weather to make it moodier, more textured, and way more cinematic. Rain looks denser, fog rolls in naturally, and it gives the city this dark, brooding soul.

Suit Packs
Swapped in custom skins: Flashpoint Batman, Batman Beyond, Dark Knight Trilogy. Each one changed how I played — different mood, different style. Sometimes you wanna be techy Future Bat, sometimes full mythic legend.

UI Overhaul
Cleans up the clutter in menus and HUD. Minimalist layout makes the experience more immersive and less “video gamey.” Also improves controller navigation.

Graphics Enhancers
Mods that sharpen shadows, clean up anti-aliasing, and boost post-processing. With these running, Gotham looked next-gen, even without RTX. You’d swear the game released yesterday.
