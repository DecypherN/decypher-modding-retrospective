Why I Got So Deep Into Modding
What started as a way to chill and escape turned into a full-on obsession with figuring stuff out — crash fixes, spell combos, weird mod conflicts. I learned:

How to fix crashes and conflicts like a boss

How to design unique gameplay experiences from scratch

How to manage huge projects with hundreds of moving parts

Patience and persistence through bugs and trial-and-error

Self-teaching skills that bleed into coding and other areas of life

What This Repo Is
This isn’t just a mod list or a game save. It’s a snapshot of how I think and learn — through curiosity, creativity, and persistence. If you like games, coding, or tweaking stuff till it’s just right, this is my story.
