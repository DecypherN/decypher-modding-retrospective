OBLIVION MODS (2025 VERSION)
A modern, stable, and immersive overhaul of Oblivion — packed with bug fixes, gameplay expansions, visual upgrades, and modding tools.

Core Fixes & Frameworks:

OBSE / xOBSE (Oblivion Script Extender)

Use xOBSE — it's the updated and maintained fork.

Fixes deep engine-level issues like crashes, heap corruption, and memory handling.

Unofficial Oblivion Patch (UOP)
Fixes thousands of bugs — quests, scripts, AI, items, and more. Absolutely essential.

ENBoost for Oblivion
Memory optimization and crash prevention. Required for stability with heavy visual mods.

TES4LODGen / TES4Edit
Tools for cleaning plugins and generating LODs for stable load orders.




Visuals & Graphics:

Oblivion Reloaded (OR 8+)
Complete graphical overhaul: dynamic shadows, SSAO, weather effects, depth of field, and more. Requires tuning.

Oblivion Upscaled Textures Project (OUTP)
AI-upscaled textures for the base game — sharpens everything without replacing the style.

Unique Landscapes Compilation
Beautifully redesigns large chunks of the world — forests, coasts, swamps, and mountains.

Improved water textures and reflections.

Higher-res trees, bushes, and grass.

Basic Primary Needs
Hunger, thirst, and sleep mechanics. Lightweight and modular.
